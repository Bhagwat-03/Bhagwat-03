Hey there! Iâ€™m Chinmay, diving headfirst into the exciting world of Embedded Systems and Machine Learningâ€”because why settle for just one when you can conquer both, right? Currently, Iâ€™m knee-deep in TensorFlow and Embedded C, trying to get machines to both think and run like pros on tiny devices. If youâ€™re into open-source projects, especially those involving AI at the edge (because who doesn't love living on the edge?), letâ€™s team up! ðŸ“¬ You can reach me at chinmaybhagwat03@gmail.com. I promise Iâ€™ll respond faster than a microcontroller in sleep mode. ðŸ˜„
